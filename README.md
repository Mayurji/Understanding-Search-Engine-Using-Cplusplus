# Understanding Search Engine with C++ Program
## Search Engine: 

A general search engine is an Internet portal through which a person can search numerous compiled resources for topic-related information. Common general search engines include Google, Yahoo!, Alta Vista and Bing. To perform a search, the user enters a word or phrase. 

## About:

What a Search Engine basically does is, it finds a particular "Sentence and its related content" on a click and then it goes on backside, it searches  each word in the sentence which is present in one particular Sentence and its nearest related and relevant contents that is available in Internet among millions of Web Pages. Search Engines uses Web crawling, Indexing and Searching to find the particular "search" in Internet.


## What to Learn:

We will Understand the methods in C++ and how we have applied all the relevant topics from c++ in our code to make our "Mini Search Engine" of two Text File and how it searches through the hundreds of search elements for every "search" we make and gives our result.

## Analogy between "Search Engine" vs "Mini Search Engine":

* Millions of Webpages  ==   Two Text Documents
* Input Field  ==  Input stream of your IDE
* Page Rank searching  == Linear Searching
* Sorting  == Sorting most relevant at top
* UnFound Match in WebPage  ==  Add the Unfound Search into one text document
* Found match - it opens all Relevant WebPages in Browser ==  Found Match - it Opens One Webpage in Browser


## Searching & Indexing Technique :

### GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE:
PageRank is technique used by Google Search Engine to Rank the Website based on the Number of incoming links to the website.Google Bot is used for Indexing the New Webpages and the process used is Crawling. 

### MINI SEARCH ENGINE:
Linear Search Technique is used to search through text files where more than 100 elements are available to search. Each of the Element is indexed and stored. When a search is made, all the relevant words searched through each element(a line) and gives out INDEX when maximum match of words in an element occurs.A match is not found then the particular is search is indexed and then added to the text file.

## Pre-Requiste :

+ XCode - Mac OS

+ Microsoft Visual Studio - Windows OS

+ Understanding of C++ and STL

+ Text-Editor

## NOTE : 

Code is expected to Return Exception and the Work is in Progress respectively
